# ContractFlow

ContractFlow is a MERN full-stack web application built with React (Vite), Express, and MongoDB that enables legal teams to securely register, log in, and manage contracts.
Users can create, assign, and update contracts, filter them by company or manager, and enforce ownership-based access. 
Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
